=== Prerequisites ===

  # install [http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html CMake] at least version 2.8.10. 
    * If you want to use Texas Instruments compiler then version 2.8.11 is needed. 
    * Even if you use version 2.8.11, coverity for Texas Instruments compiler will not work correctly because at least coverity client in version 4.5.0 doesn't understand compiler long name switches (e.g. `--cpp_file`). The switches are defined in CMake in file `CMAKE_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY/Modules/Compiler/TI-*.cmake`. In CMake version that I use, I manually change long name switches to its short names.
  # svn command line client has to be installed
  # sed utility has to installed
  # java has to be installed

  # checkout Simple Build Enviroment
    * `svn checkout http://cmake-simple-build-environment.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cmake-simple-build-environment-read-only`
  # install checkouted sources
    * `cd cmake-simple-build-environment-read-only`
    * `mkdir build`
    * `cd build`

      * On linux
        * `sudo make install`
