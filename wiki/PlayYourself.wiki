  # install [http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html CMake] at least version 2.8.10
  # install [Installation Simple Build Environment]
  # svn command line client has to be installed
  # sed utility has to installed
  # java has to be installed

=== Try ===

I use linux Debian, but is should work on any other system.

  # checkout [http://code.google.com/p/sbe-helloworld HelloWorld]
    * `svn checkout http://sbe-helloworld.googlecode.com/svn/tags/rel_1_0_0 sbe-helloworld-read-only`
  # create build directory and configure
    * `cd sbe-helloworld-read-only`
    * `mkdir build`
    * `cd build`
    * `cmake ..`
  # run tests
    * `make test`

You will see 
  * how dependencies are exported and installed for HelloWorld.
  * How test are build and executed
