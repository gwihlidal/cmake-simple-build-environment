= Simple build environment concept =

The project provides CMake scripts usable in CMakeLists.txt of CPP package.

CPP package can be
  * Library (e.g [https://code.google.com/p/sbe-documentlibrary/source/browse/trunk/#trunk DocumentLibrary])
  * Executable
  * Project - group of Libraries/Executable (e.g [https://code.google.com/p/sbe-documentationsystem/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk DocumentationSystem])

The scripts supports
  * Dependency management
  * Build 
  * Unit testing
  * Continuous Integration
  * Coverity

== Dependency management ==

Each package has file Properties.cmake. The file contains package description(e.g. [https://code.google.com/p/sbe-documentlibrary/source/browse/trunk/Properties.cmake Properties.cmake for DocumentLibrary]).

One property is `DEPENDENCIES`. It contains description of each dependency used by package.

=== How it works ===

In your package CMakeLists.txt you have to include [https://code.google.com/p/cmake-simple-build-environment/source/browse/trunk/scripts/DeployDependencies.cmake DeployDependencies.cmake] (e.g. [https://code.google.com/p/sbe-documentlibrary/source/browse/trunk/CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txt for DocumentLibrary])

The script performs two steps
  * Exports sources (it uses [https://code.google.com/p/cmake-simple-build-environment/source/browse/trunk/scripts/ExportDependencies.cmake ExportDependencies.cmake])
  * Install sources (it uses [https://code.google.com/p/cmake-simple-build-environment/source/browse/trunk/scripts/InstallDependencies.cmake InstallDependencies.cmake])

==== Export Sources ====

The script [https://code.google.com/p/cmake-simple-build-environment/source/browse/trunk/scripts/ExportDependencies.cmake ExportDependencies.cmake] uses `DEPENDENCIES` property defined in CMakeLists.txt to get all dependencies URL in repository.

It exports Properties.cmake recursively for each dependency and generates file dependencies/info/info.cmake in package. The file contains all properties from all dependencies.

Once all properties from all dependencies are exported, scripts performs
  # make dependency picture - it uses [http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/ plantuml]
  # check dependencies versions and report error if any - now exact version has to be used
  # check dependencies installation order and report error if any
  # remove unused dependencies
  # exports dependencies sources
